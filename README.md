## Set up
- Clone this repository to your packages directory
- Save a new project in SublimeText
- Command palette: "LatexOutliner: Set up project"
- press `?` for help in the outline view
- If the outline view is not responding e.g. after you close and open the project, close it and use "LatexOuteliner: Show outline on the left"

## Todos
- move and in/outdent item with super h,j,k,l
- move cursor with j,k
- Enable build tex from outline view 
- Refresh dead outline view

### Later
- import outline from filesystem
- export outline to filesystem
- nicer style for outline view (check dired.hiddentmTheme)
- hide cursor?

### Wishlist
